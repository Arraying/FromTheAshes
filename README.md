# Phoenix

A mod that introduces quality of life changes.

### HUD

The HUD is the centerpiece of Phoenix. It provides the following information:
- Current FPS
- X, Y, Z coordinates
- Direction facing and which axis this is

The HUD can be toggled using `RSHIFT`, and is disabled when debug information is shown.

### Zoom

OptiFine-esque zoom that will set the FOV to 1/3rd of what it used to be.
While zoomed in, smooth movement is enabled.

Zoom mode is enabled as long as `C` is held down.
